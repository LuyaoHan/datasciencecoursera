## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## R Data Types and Attributes
**character** 

**numeric(real numbers)**

**integer**

**complex**

**logical(True/False)**

All things we encountered in R is an object. These five data types comprises the atomic classes of objects. 
The most basic object is a vector. It can contain multiple copies of multiple types of objects. 

Empty vectors can be created with **vector()** function

**list** is a special vector that can contain mulitple types of classes (character, integer, complex...)


# Numbers
Numbers are always thought as real numbers 
If you specifically want an integer, you need to specify the L suffix.

**Inf** is 1/0

1 / **Inf** is 0 

**Nan** stands for Not a number

## Creating Vectors

The **c()** function can be used to create vectors of objects

x <- c(0.5, 0.6)

x <- c(True, False)

x <- c(T,F)

x <- c('a','b','c')

x <- 9:29

x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i)    

### Using the Vector function
x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
```{r}
x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
print(x)
```

### Create a vector and mixing two types of objects (not recommended: **Inplicit Type Coercion Happens!**)
```{r}
y <- c(1.7,"a")
print(y)
```
In above, number is coerced into all string



```{r}
y <- c(TRUE,2)
print(y)
```
In above logic is coerced into all integer


```{r}
y <-c("a",TRUE) 
print(y)
```
In above, logic is coerced into string


## Explicit Type Coercion (Class Conversion)
```{r}
x <- 0:6
class(x)
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.character(x)
```

### Coercion will not always work
```{r}
x <- c("a","b","c")
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.complex(x)
```




## Lists
Lists are a special type of vector **can** contain elements of different class(or type). 
```{r}
x <- list(1, "a",TRUE, 1+4i)
x
```
It doesn't print out like a vector.
